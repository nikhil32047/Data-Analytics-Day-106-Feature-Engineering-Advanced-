Feature Engineering (Advanced)

Today's focus: techniques that dramatically improve model performance in real-world ML projects.

🔹 Lesson 1: Feature Scaling (Standardization & Normalization)
=====================================================================
Why it matters:
Most ML models perform better when features are on similar scales.

Types of Scaling

Useful for: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA

Normalization (Min-Max)

Useful for: Neural Networks, KNN
Real-World Example:
Scaling customer income before clustering helps avoid bias in K-Means.

🔹 Lesson 2: Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE, Undersampling, Oversampling)
===============================================================================
Why it matters:
Real-world datasets rarely have 50/50 class distribution — e.g., fraud cases are only 1%.

Techniques
SMOTE: Creates synthetic minority examples
Random Oversampling: Duplicates minority samples
Undersampling: Removes majority samples
Real-World Example:
Fraud detection models trained with SMOTE get higher recall.

🔹 Lesson 3: Feature Binning (Discretization)
==================================================
Convert continuous values into categories.
Techniques
Equal-width binning
Equal-frequency binning
Domain-based binning (age groups: 18–25, 26–35, etc.)
Real-World Example:
Banking risk models group customer ages for stability in scoring.

🔹 Lesson 4: Polynomial Features
======================================
Add squared, cubic, and interaction terms to capture nonlinear patterns.

Example
----------
Predicting house price:
Add features like
area²
bedrooms × area
This helps linear models behave like nonlinear ones.

🔹 Lesson 5: Target Encoding
===================================
Convert categories into numerical values based on target averages.

Example:
----------
If the target is "likelihood of purchase":
Traffic_Source = Instagram → 0.62
Traffic_Source = Google → 0.41
Where it’s used:
Customer conversion prediction
Churn models
